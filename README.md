Petting Zoo Python Project Summary
This project was designed to help learn the basics of Python classes and object-oriented programming. The main features and concepts practiced include:

Class Creation: Defined multiple animal classes (e.g., Llama, Donkey, Frog) in separate modules, each representing a different type of animal.
Class Attributes: Used attributes like name, species, shift, food, and date_added to store information about each animal.
Instance Methods: Added methods such as feed() to perform actions specific to each animal, demonstrating how to define and use methods within a class.
Special Methods: Implemented the __str__ method to provide a readable string representation of each animal object.
Object Instantiation: Created instances of each animal class with specific attribute values, showing how to pass arguments to constructors.
Modular Organization: Organized code into separate files and folders by animal type (walking, swimming, slithering), and used imports to bring classes together in a main script.
Printing and Output: Used print statements to display information about each animal and their feeding schedule.
Overall, this project provided hands-on experience with Python classes, constructors, methods, and modular code organization.
